===========

For documenting git workflows; there's no code here.

Testing the code audit trail, which isn't actually a part of the workflow I'm setting up but I'm curious.

What is arc like when you're offline?

Still not sure.

That answers that: [Transport/4] (http://phabricator.l/api/conduit.connect) Connection could not be initiated. This usually indicates a DNS problem: verify the domain name is correct, that you can perform a DNS lookup for it from this machine. (Did you add the domain to `/etc/hosts` on some other machine, but not this one?) This might also indicate that you specified the wrong port.
(Run with --trace for a full exception trace.)
